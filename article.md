# Title

Do you share your projects in the Dataquest community? I do!  I have benefited a lot from various people sharing their insights on my work. As I've progressed, I've started giving back and showing other people what I would have done differently in their notebooks. I've even started writing a generic post about the most important comments on our projects. This led me to the idea of an interesting project: 
* extract all the feedback data and gather it in one dataset
* analyze the dataset
* using machine learning to enhance the analysis. 

This article is a the first post in series of posts describing my project. To really benefit from this article you should have a good understanding of pandas library and regex usage in cleaning data. We'll focus on web scraping so elementary HTML is very helpful, but you should survive without it.

I have divided this project into three stages, all of them are not that complicated on their own. But as we combine them together, it starts to look interesting:

* Part 1: Scrape the data - we'll use the Beautiful Soup library to gather all the necessary string values from the website and store them in a pandas dataframe.
* Part 2: Clean and analyse the data - we should be well accustomed to this part. Webscraping very often delivers 'dirty' text values. It is normal for the scraper to pick up a few extra signs or lines of HTML during the process. We'll use regular expression techniques to transform that data into something more useful.
* Part 3: Use machine learning models on the data. Why perform the analysis yourself, when you can send the machine to do that work for you?

Let's get to work:
# Part 1 - scraping the data from Dataquest's community forum
If you haven't used BeautifulSoup yet, then I encourage you to check my introduction notebook. It follows a similar path that we're going to take: scraping not one, but many websites. 

Let's have a look at how the actual Guided project post looks, so we can have a better idea on what we want to achieve:

This is the main thread of Guided Projects. It contains all of our Guided Projects, that we've decided to publish. Most of them received a reply with some comments - we're interested in the contents of that reply:

<img width="918" alt="feedback" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87883118/144956671-3c8dc0bc-1922-4a12-9c73-5e4b549d93af.png">


In this post, Michael published his project and Elena replied with some remarks to his work. We're interested in scraping only the content of Elena's remarks. It is not going to be as easy as scraping one website, because we want to scrape a specific part of many websites, to which we don't have the links...yet. Here's the plan of attack:
1. We don't have the links to all of the Guided project posts - we need to obtain them, which means we'll have to scrape the main thread of Guided Projects
2. After scraping the main thread we'll create a dataframe containing posts, titles, links and... number of replies
  * We'll filter out posts with no replies
3. The remaining dataset should contain only the posts that received feedback and the links to those posts - we can commence scraping the actual individual posts

## Very basic HTML intro:

Before we start, have you ever seen a HTML code? It differs from Python. If you've never experienced HTML code, here's a very basic example of a table in HTML:
```html
<html>
<body>
<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
   <td><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/">dataquest</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
 </body>
 </html>
```
<html>
<body>
<table border=1>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
    <td><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/">dataquest</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>
 
In HTML we use tags to define elements. Many elements have an opening tag and a closing tag â€” for an example ```<table>``` opens up the building of a table and at the very end of coding the table we write ```</table>``` to close it. This table has 1 row (have you guessed it's ```<tr>``` for a row?) and 3 cells in that row. In the third cell we've spiced up the atmosphere a little - we used a link (```<a href=...>```). HTML tags can have atributes (we've used 'border' atribute in 'table' tag and 'href' atribute in 'a' tag).    

The whole concept of webscraping is to extract (scrape) specific elements of a website.

## Step 1:

We'll begin with inspecting the contents of the whole website: https://community.dataquest.io/c/share/guided-project/55
We can use our browser for that, I personally use Chrome. Just hover your mouse above the title of the post right-click it and choose Inspect, (BUT pay attention! 
I've chosen a post that's a few posts below the top - just in case the first posts has a different class). 

Now we can actually look at the code of the website, when you hover your mouse cursor above certain elements of the code in the right window, the browser will highlight that element in the left window, in the below example my cursor is hovering above the ```<tr data-topic-id=...>``` and on the left side we can observe a big chunk of the website being highlighted:

<img width="1092" alt="inspect" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87883118/145134328-abb52874-0bc5-4bc9-a952-662d44fe00d6.png">

For our first attempt we'll try to obtain only the links of every post. You can notice that the actual link has a class 'title raw-link raw-topic-link', it's in the second line of the code below:

```html
<a href="/t/predicting-bike-rentals-with-machine-learning-optimization-of-the-linear-model/558618/3" role="heading"
   level="2" class="title raw-link raw-topic-link" data-topic-id="558618"><span dir="ltr">Predicting Bike Rentals 
  With Machine Learning, Optimization of the Linear Model</span></a>
```
We'll use the below code to scrape all the links with that class into one list and see how many we've managed to extract:

```python
# imports:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request

# step 1 lets scrape the guided project website with all the posts:
url = "https://community.dataquest.io/c/share/guided-project/55"
html = urlopen(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

# look for every 'a' tag with 'class' title raw-link raw-topic-link:
list_all = soup.find_all("a", class_="title raw-link raw-topic-link")

# check how many elements we've extracted:
len(list_all)
```
\[Output]: 30

Our list has only 30 elements! We were expecting a bigger number, what happened? Unfortunately we're trying to scrape a dynamic website. (a more [in depth article](https://www.zesty.io/mindshare/marketing-technology/dynamic-vs-static-websites/) on the matter). Dataquest loads only the first 30 posts when our browser opens the forums page, if we want to see more we have to scroll down. But how do we program our scraper to scroll down? [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) is a go-to solution for that issue but we're going to use something much simpler: 
* scroll down to the bottom of the website
* when we reach the end save the website as file
* instead of processing a link with BeautifulSoup, we'll process that file

Let's get to scrolling down:

![20211207_132125](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87883118/145162982-e907978a-5ff0-49ca-8830-f377618ddb52.jpg)

Yes that is an actual fork pushing down the 'down arrow' on the keyboard, weighted down with an empty coffee cup (the author of this post does not encourage any unordinary use of cutlery or dishware around your electronic equipment). Having scrolled down to the very bottom, we can save the website using > File > Save Page As... Now we can load that file into our notebook and commence scraping, this time we'll target every new row ```tr```. Because ultimately we're not interested in scraping just the links, we want to extract as much data as possible. As you remember when we hovered the mouse cursor over ```<tr ...>``` tag a lot has been highlighted. Not only the title, with link, but also amount of replies, views etc.

```python
import codecs
# this is the file of the website, after scrolling all the way down:
file = codecs.open("../input/dq-projects/projects.html", "r", "utf-8")
# parse the file:
parser = BeautifulSoup(file, 'html.parser')

# look for every 'tr' tag, scrape its contents and create a pandas series from the list:
list_all = parser.find_all('tr')
series_4_df = pd.Series(list_all)

# create a dataframe from pandas series:
df = pd.DataFrame(series_4_df, columns=['content'])
df['content'] = df['content'].astype(str)
df.head()
```
||content|
|----|----|
|0|```<tr><th class="default" data-sort-order="defau...```|
|1|```<tr class="topic-list-item category-share-guid...```|
|2|```<tr class="topic-list-item category-share-guid...```|
|3|```<tr class="topic-list-item category-share-guid...```|
|4|```<tr class="topic-list-item category-share-guid...```|

## We've arrived at step 2
We have created a dataframe filled with a lot of HTML code. Let's inspect the content of one cell:
```python
df.loc[2,'content'] 
```
```html
<tr class="topic-list-item category-share-guided-project tag-257 tag-sql-fundamentals tag-257-8 has-excerpt 
unseen-topic ember-view" data-topic-id="558357" id="ember71">\n<td class="main-link clearfix" colspan="">\n

aria-label="noah.gampe - Original Poster, Most Recent Poster" class="avatar latest single" height="25" 
src="./Latest Share_Guided Project topics - Dataquest Community_files/12175_2.png" 
title="noah.gampe - Original Poster, Most Recent Poster" width="25"/></a>\n</td>\n<td class="num posts-map posts" 
title="This topic has 0 replies">\n<button class="btn-link posts-map badge-posts">\n<span 
aria-label="This topic has 0 replies" class="number">0</span>\n</button>\n</td>\n<td class="num

 </td>\n<td class="num age activity" title="First post: Nov 20, 2021 9:25 am\nPosted: Nov 20, 2021 9:27 am">\n
 <a class="post-activity" href="https://community.dataquest.io/t/analyzing-cia-factbook-with-sql-full-project/558357/1">
  <span class="relative-date" data-format="tiny" data-time="1637360860367">1d</span></a>\n</td>\n</tr>
```
How to find order in this madness? We only need 2 elements from the above code (but we'll try to extract more).
The title in the above block of code is "Analyzing CIA Factbook with SQL - Full Project", we can find the title inside the span element:
```html
<span dir="ltr">Analyzing CIA Factbook with SQL - Full Project</span>
 ```
The previous element is the link we're after:
```html
<a class="title raw-link
raw-topic-link" data-topic-id="558357" href="https://community.dataquest.io/t/analyzing-cia-factbook-with-sql-full-project/558357"
level="2" role="heading">
 ```
 The last bit of information we're after is number of replies for each post:
```html
<span aria-label="This topic has 0 replies" class="number">0</span>
```
We could use BeautifulSoup to target those specific elements and extract their content, but this dataset is not that big and extracting the information
we need directly from the cell in the same row seems like a bit safer option. 
* We'll remove the first row (which is not a post element)
* then we'll proceed with regex magic to extract the title, link and number of replies
* we'll remove the rows with 0 replies

```python
# remove 1st row:
df = df.iloc[1:,:]

# extract title, link and number of replies:
df['title'] = df['content'].str.extract('<span dir="ltr">(.*?)</span>')
df['link'] = df['content'].str.extract('href=(.*?)level="2"')
df['replies'] = df['content'].str.extract("This topic has (.*?) re").astype(int)
df['views'] = df['content'].str.extract("this topic has been viewed (.*?) times")
df['views'] = df['views'].str.replace(',','').astype(int)

# remove 1 generic post and posts with 0 replies:
df = df[df['replies']>0]
df = df[df['replies']<100]
df.head()
```

## Step 3: scraping the individual posts
This last step is not going to be much different than step 1 of scraping, we have to inspect one individual post and deduct which element of the page is responsible for the content of the first reply to the post. We're making an assumption that the most valuable content is going to be stored in the first reply to the published project. We'll ignore all the other replies.
        
To process this amount of text data we'll create a function. All the heavy data processing is being done inside the function and we don't have to worry about some variables occupying the memory after we're done working with them. **[[[FIND A GOOD ARTICLE ABOUT MEMORY LEAKS PASTE HERE]]]**  
        
```python
# create a function for scraping the actual posts website:
def get_reply(one_link):
    response = requests.get(one_link)
    content = response.content
    parser = BeautifulSoup(content, 'html.parser')
    tag_numbers = parser.find_all("div", class_="post")
    # we're only going to scrape the content of the first reply (that's usually the feedback)
    feedback = tag_numbers[1].text
    return feedback
```
Here's a very important rule I follow whenever performing web-scraping:
START SMALL!

You don't want to scrape a few thousand websites just to learn that your last line of code didn't work and you have to redo everything and wait again. That is why we'll start with a very small dataset, check if everything is clicking, then move on to deeper waters.

```python
# create a test dataframe to test scraping on 5 rows:
df_test = df[:5].copy()

# we'll use a loop on all the elements of pd.Series (faster than using 'apply')
feedback_list = []
for el in df_test['link2']:
    feedback_list.append(get_reply(el))
df_test['feedback'] = feedback_list
df_test
 ```
<!-- |index|feedback|

Looks promising, let's check the whole cell:
```python
df_test['feedback'][4]
```
'\nprocessing data inside a function saves memory (the variables you create stay inside the function and are not stored in memory, when youâ€™re done with the function) itâ€™s important when youâ€™re working with larger datasets - if youâ€™re interested with experimenting:\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page\nTry cleaning 1 month of this dataset on kaggle notebook (and look at your RAM usage) outside the function and inside the function, compare the RAM usage in both examples\n'

Whole reply, ready for cleaning. Now let's move on to a bigger boat (this will take a while):
```python
# this lets scrape all the posts, not just 5 of them:
def scrape_replies(df):
    feedback_list = []
    for el in df['link']:
        feedback_list.append(get_reply(el))
    df['feedback'] = feedback_list
    return df
    
df = scrape_replies(df)
```

That's it, we've extracted all the raw data we've wanted from the dataquests websites. In the next post we'll focus on cleaning and analyzing this data using natural language processing techniques.  

Things to consider:
* scraping tool - BeautifulSoup is a great library to start with, but you've probably noticed that we've already came across it's limitations, to perform web scraping on complex dynamic websites we should use a more advanced tool (We'll try to cover Selenium library in the future)
* memory usage
* internet transfer
* Consider the server if you're constantly requesting a LOT of content from a website, most of the servers will pick up on it and very often cut you off. In our specific example, we asked for a big chunk of data an  but it's a good habbit to stop the web-scraping 

```
```python
# this lets scrape all the posts, not just 5 of them:
def scrape_replies(df):
    feedback_list = []
    for el in df['link']:
        feedback_list.append(get_reply(el))
    df['feedback'] = feedback_list
    return df
    
df = scrape_replies(df)
```
```
